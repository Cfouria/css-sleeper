The goal of this script was to toggle styles at random in the hope that a website(youtube) becomes more friendly/easier/nicer. And, when you find what you like, it will be kept.
The way this works is split all styles into groups add an 'all' and an 'empty' group, so that a group is toggled at once.
The button with a C on it enables all and then disables 1 group.
The button with a S on it toggles 1 group at a time.
Both C and S share the same index of which group it will target on next click.
It is not to try every combination.
The N targets elements with 'style' attribute, clearing it and if empty ~removes~ the element.
Fontkill ~removes~ a style containing the word 'font'.
The Keep button will put the list of buttons clicked in localstorage, in order.
Clear will remove the list from localstorage and enabled the styles that remain.
And an input that when clicked will +1 the amount of 'buckets'.
Note: the number does not match the amount of buckets. There are +2 buckets: 1 with all styles and 1 with no styles.
